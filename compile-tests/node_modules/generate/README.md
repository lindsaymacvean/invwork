Generate is a fast, well-tested (more than 1,000 unit tests), and highly pluggable project generator for node.js.

**Feature highlights**

* Generators can have gulp-style "tasks" (gulp plugins can be used too)
* Supports sub-generators, with any level of nesting!
* Generators can extend and use other generators
* Generators, sub-generators and their tasks can be run by command line or API
* Generate can be used as a node.js library, to add generate's functionality to other applications (for example, generate is used in [assemble](http://assemble.io))

## Getting started

### Install

To get started, you'll first need to install `generate` globally using [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/), along with any generators you'd like to run.

**Install Generate**

Install globally with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i -g generate
```

***

## Usage

```sh
$ gen <command> [args]
```

## CLI

_(WIP)_

### help

_(TODO)_

Get started with Generate.

```js
$ gen help
```

### init

_(TODO)_

Get started with Generate.

```js
$ gen init
```

Upon running `init`, generate will prompt you for answers to the following questions:

### Run generators

```sh
$ gen <generator name> [options]
```

**Example**

Run generator `abc`

```sh
$ gen abc
```

### Run tasks

To run a task on the `base` generator, just pass the name of the task to run.

```sh
$ gen <task name> [options]
```

Unless overridden by the user, the `base` generator is the default generator that ships with Generate. This generator doesn't really "generate" anything, but it will prompt you for a few answers (if you choose), to store data that's commonly needed by templates, like `author.name`, GitHub `username`, etc.

**Example**

Run task `bar`:

```sh
$ gen bar
```

### Run sub-generators

> Sub-generators are normal generators that are called from (or registered by) other generators.

Dot-notation is used for getting and runing sub-generators.

```sh
$ gen <generator name>.<sub-generator name> [options]
```

**Examples**

Run sub-generator `b` on generator `a`:

```sh
$ gen a.b [options]
```

Run sub-generator `c`:

```sh
$ gen a.b.c [options]
```

And so on...

### Run a generator's tasks

```sh
$ gen <generator name>:<task name> [options]
```

**Example**

Run task `bar` on generator `foo`.

```sh
$ gen foo:bar 
```

### Run a sub-generator's tasks

```sh
$ gen <generator name>.<sub-generator name>:<task name> [options]
```

**Example**

Run task `foo` on sub.generator `a.b.c`.

```sh
$ gen a.b.c:foo 
```

## API

{%= apidocs("index.js") %}

## Task API

### [.task](https:/github.com/jonschlinkert/composer/blob/master/index.js#L68)

Register a new task with it's options and dependencies. To return the task object of an already registered task, pass the name of the task without any additional parameters.

**Params**

* `name` **{String}**: Name of the task to register
* `options` **{Object}**: Options to set dependencies or control flow.
* `options.deps` **{Object}**: array of dependencies
* `options.flow` **{Object}**: How this task will be executed with it's dependencies (`series`, `parallel`, `settleSeries`, `settleParallel`)
* `deps` **{String|Array|Function}**: Additional dependencies for this task.
* `fn` **{Function}**: Final function is the task to register.
* `returns` **{Object}**: Return the instance for chaining

**Example**

```js
// register task "site" with composer
app.task('site', ['styles'], function() {
  return app.src('templates/pages/*.hbs')
    .pipe(app.dest('_gh_pages'));
});

// get the "site" task object
var task = app.task('site');
```

### [.build](https:/github.com/jonschlinkert/composer/blob/master/index.js#L125)

Build a task or array of tasks.

**Params**

* `tasks` **{String|Array|Function}**: List of tasks by name, function, or array of names/functions.
* `cb` **{Function}**: Callback function to be called when all tasks are finished building.

**Example**

```js
app.build('default', function(err, results) {
  if (err) return console.error(err);
  console.log(results);
});
```

### [.series](https:/github.com/jonschlinkert/composer/blob/master/index.js#L181)

Compose task or list of tasks into a single function that runs the tasks in series.

**Params**

* `tasks` **{String|Array|Function}**: List of tasks by name, function, or array of names/functions.
* `returns` **{Function}**: Composed function that may take a callback function.

**Example**

```js
app.task('foo', function(done) {
  console.log('this is foo');
  done();
});

var fn = app.series('foo', function bar(done) {
  console.log('this is bar');
  done();
});

fn(function(err) {
  if (err) return console.error(err);
  console.log('done');
});
//=> this is foo
//=> this is bar
//=> done
```

### [.parallel](https:/github.com/jonschlinkert/composer/blob/master/index.js#L213)

Compose task or list of tasks into a single function that runs the tasks in parallel.

**Params**

* `tasks` **{String|Array|Function}**: List of tasks by name, function, or array of names/functions.
* `returns` **{Function}**: Composed function that may take a callback function.

**Example**

```js
app.task('foo', function(done) {
  setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('this is foo');
    done();
  }, 500);
});

var fn = app.parallel('foo', function bar(done) {
  console.log('this is bar');
  done();
});

fn(function(err) {
  if (err) return console.error(err);
  console.log('done');
});
//=> this is bar
//=> this is foo
//=> done
```

### [.watch](https:/github.com/jonschlinkert/composer/blob/master/index.js#L230)

Watch a file, directory, or glob pattern for changes and build a task or list of tasks when changes are made. Watch is powered by [chokidar][] so arguments can be anything supported by [chokidar.watch](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar#api).

**Params**

* `glob` **{String|Array}**: Filename, Directory name, or glob pattern to watch
* `options` **{Object}**: Additional options to be passed to [chokidar][]
* `tasks` **{String|Array|Function}**: Tasks that are passed to `.build` when files in the glob are changed.

**Example**

```js
var watcher = app.watch('templates/pages/*.hbs', ['site']);
```

```

### [.symlink](https:/github.com/assemble/assemble-fs/blob/master/index.js#L91)

Glob patterns or paths for symlinks.

**Params**

* `glob` **{String|Array}**

## Authoring generators

_(TODO)_

### Generator naming conventions

**Do**

Use `generate-` as the prefix, followed by any words of your choosing to describe the purpose of the generator.

**Don't**

Use `generator-` as the prefix, since the word `generator` is already associated with yeoman.

## TODO

* [x] publish a fast, composable, highly extendable project generator with a user-friendly and expressive API
* [x] support sub-generators (to any level of nesting)
* [x] support streams, tasks, and plugins compatible with both [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) and [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-core)
* [x] make it super easy to run specific tasks from any generator or sub-generator, programmatically or via CLI
* [x] support _instance plugins_ that allow you to easily add functionality and features to generate
* [x] support any template engine
* [x] support using any number of template engines at once, so that different file types can simultaneously be handled by the engine that was registered for that file type
* [x] support templates as [vinyl](http://github.com/gulpjs/vinyl) files, simple to use template collections and lists (for pagination, sorting, groups etc)
* [x] support middleware that can be run on all files or specific files, and at specific points during the _build process_ (like `onLoad`, `preRender`, `postRender`, etc)
* [x] 1,000+ unit tests
* [ ] create and publish generators (we created a handful of generators that we've been using locally, these will be published shortly)
* [ ] CLI docs (started)
* [ ] User help (e.g. when the user does `gen help` or just `gen`)
* [ ] API docs
* [ ] Generator guidelines and conventions

## Why Generate?

* Generate is an MIT licensed, open source project
* Generate was designed to be a faster, smarter, more extensible alternative to the current dominent solutions.
* Generate has an expressive, imperitive API. If you like gulp or express, you might like generate too.
* Generate is modular, and built on top of great libraries like [bach](https://github.com/phated/bach), [composer](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/composer) and [assemble-core](https://github.com/assemble/assemble-core)
* Generate is brought to you by [@jonschlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert) and [@doowb](https://github.com/doowb), whose projects - such as [assemble](http://assemble.io) and [micromatch](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/micromatch) - are downloaded more than 200 million times a month.
